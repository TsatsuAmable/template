    "summary": "I am an engineering professional who has a sound understanding of relational database technologies and tools in the microsoft office ecosystem. I have experience working with Relational Database Technologies and tools including Microsoft SQL Server, Python, Php, Java, Microsoft Office Access, among others. I have also worked with other technologies, ranging from cloud (Amazon Web Services) to geospatial information systems (GIS), systems administration (Linux & Windows) and content management systems. I enjoy expanding my knowledge and have picked up skills in training, facilitation, administration and leadership. I have had the opportunity to facilitate the training of young minds and have immensely enjoyed being able to share the knowledge I have with others. I am eager to explore new trajectories in IT and I quickly jump on board when faced with new information I previously was unacquainted with. My career goal is to be part of a team that values continuous growth and training as it presents new opportunities and experiences for growth.
